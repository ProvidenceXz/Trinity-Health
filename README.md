Repo for Trinity Health Software as a Service!

**Summary**

A collaborative software tool that enables medical specialists from different disciplines to exchange expertise
and collectively decide on a patient’s treatment plan.
Our app consists of three core features:
First, doctors can create cases for patients and invite their colleagues to collaborate.
Second, they can upload and share clinical files and other relevant data with their colleagues.
Lastly, they can share and receive updates in the form of notes on the patients’ conditions.
